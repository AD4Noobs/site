By now we covered most of the features that makes AD appealing to enterprises.

We covered how:
- Information is stored about users and devices (Objects and Attributes)
- The central authentication is handled (Really basic overview of Security Principals)
- How access can be given to a resource (We setup a simple File Share)

But we haven't how certain configuration/policy user or computer settings are deployed.
