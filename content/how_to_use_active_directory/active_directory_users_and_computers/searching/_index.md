To search for objects in ADUC, right click on the root domain and click on `Find...`.

Try finding the user `Guybrush Threepwood` by typing `Guy` and pressing enter.

By default the `Find selection` is set to `Users, Contacts and Groups`. Meaning if you try to search for a computer you won't be able to find it. If you want to search for computers you will have to update the `Find selection`.
