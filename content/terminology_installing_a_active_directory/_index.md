During that installation process we saw a bunch of technical terms and options fly by. These things are actually rather important things to understand if you want to learn about Active Directory, so let's cover them now!

Before we can cover Domains, Tree's and Forests we first need to cover what objects are and the things that come with them. This is the stuff about AD that makes it complicated, dull, and sometimes hard to grasp. So, let's try to have some fun with it. 

Once you understand this you already got one of the core features of AD covered:

- ***Store information about members of the domain (such as devices and users);***
- Providers central authentication for the network;
- Allows or restricts access to resources/applications in the network;
- Enforce the appropriate configuration/policy of user or computer settings.
