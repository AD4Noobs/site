# Prep work

Before we can start with the actual meat of this guide we need to do some prep work. If I'm teaching this guide as a workshop you must you finish this chapter before the workshop date. We will simply not have enough time if we have to include the installation and preparation of multiple Windows VM's. Even though time is a issue i'd like to include this process incase people have never done this before (in place of automating it with something like [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)).

If you run into any problems during the setup please contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinperdok).
