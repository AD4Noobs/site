So now that we know our Active Directory can contain Donkeys, Ogre's, Dragons and Castles we can talk about the Active Directory Schema. The schema of Active Directory defines the rules how a object class looks like, what attributes are mandatory and are which ones optional. It's basically a giant collection of blueprints for all objects classes in Active Directory. The schema itself is shared between all the domains (and tree's) in Active Directory (forest).
